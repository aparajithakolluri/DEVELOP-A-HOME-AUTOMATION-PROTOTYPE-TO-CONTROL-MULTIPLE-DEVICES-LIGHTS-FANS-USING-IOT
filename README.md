This prototype aims to demonstrate a basic home automation system that allows remote control of multiple devices, such as lights and fans, using a smartphone or web application. The system will leverage an IoT platform (Blynk or MQTT) to facilitate communication between the devices and the control interface.
Hardware Components:
Microcontroller: An Arduino or ESP32 development board will serve as the brain of the system. It will handle the low-level control of the devices, process sensor data, and communicate with the IoT platform.
Relays or MOSFETs: These electronic switches will be used to control the power supply to the lights and fans, allowing the microcontroller to turn them on and off remotely.
Sensors (Optional): Depending on the desired level of sophistication, sensors such as light sensors, motion sensors, or temperature and humidity sensors can be integrated to trigger automated actions (e.g., automatically turning on lights when it gets dark).
Power Supply: A suitable power supply will be needed to provide power to the microcontroller, relays, and sensors.   
Software Components:
IoT Platform:
Blynk: A user-friendly platform with a drag-and-drop interface for creating mobile and web applications. It provides a simple way to connect devices and visualize data.    
Microcontroller Code:
The code will be written in C/C++ for the chosen microcontroller (Arduino or ESP32).
It will handle:
Reading sensor data (if applicable).
Controlling the relays/MOSFETs to switch the devices on/off.
Communicating with the IoT platform (publishing and subscribing to messages).
Smartphone/Web Application:
A user interface will be created using the Blynk app or a custom web application.
It will allow users to:
Manually control the devices (turn on/off).
Monitor the status of the devices (on/off).
View sensor data (if applicable).
Configure automated actions (if desired).
Prototype Development Steps:
Hardware Setup: Assemble the hardware components, connecting the microcontroller to the relays/MOSFETs, sensors (if used), and power supply.
Software Development:
Microcontroller Code: Write the code for the microcontroller, incorporating the necessary libraries for communication with the chosen IoT platform.
Smartphone/Web Application: Create the user interface for controlling the devices.
IoT Platform Configuration: Configure the IoT platform (Blynk or MQTT broker) and establish communication between the microcontroller and the platform.
Testing and Refinement: Thoroughly test the system, ensuring that all devices can be controlled remotely and that all functionalities work as expected. Refine the system based on testing results.
